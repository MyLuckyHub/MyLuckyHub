<p><strong>写作（3套）</strong></p>
<p><strong>第一套：</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay on the use of online dictionaries. You can start your essay with the sentence “The use of online dictionaries is becoming increasingly popular.” You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.</strong></p>
<p> Online dictionaries are becoming increasingly popular. Consequently , people are getting more opportunities to speak or meet another language but their own mother tongue with the development of the economy. Undoubtedly , online dictionaries is crucial for people who cannot handle the language perfectly. But the viewpoints are split one whether this kind of apps are wholly a good thing.<br> Where there is a light , there is a shadow. Some people argue that online dictionaries will bridge them with the native speakers adequately no matter who will be a traveler or a businessman. It will pose a huge threat for people who can not understand what they say. Fortunately , everyone will interact richly with the online dictionaries like this. On the other hand, some people think that online dictionaries cannot fully create and convey the feelings on the authentic language. As a result , it will bring more misunderstandings. Besides, the opponents take the point of view that people will be more over-reliant on the mobile-phones and Internet.<br>  Form where I stand , I would take online dictionaries on this kind of apps as a reference rather than a kind of dependence. The most effective and beneficial way to express yourself and communicate with a foreigner is to improve one’s ability to exert this unfamiliar language. As an old saying goes is Practice makes perfect.</p>
<p><strong>第二套：</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay on the use of online libraries. You can start your essay with the sentence “The use of online libraries is becoming increasingly popular.” You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.</strong></p>
<p>Online Libraries<br> Online libraries are becoming increasingly popular，which has become an essential part in people’s life. Just as a coin has two sides, online libraries also have their advantages and disadvantages.<br> On the one hand, online libraries can provide abundant resources with small volume. Readers can make use of online libraries without the limit of time and space. What’s more, online libraries can transmit information quickly, as well as share resources efficiently.<br> On the other hand, the use of online libraries is restricted by certain conditions, for example, it must be connected with network to be used. If there is a malfunction, it cannot be read. Moreover, the content of online libraries is faced with the risk of being distorted and sometimes the security of the content is poor. What’s worse, if use online library more often, it’s bad for the readers’ eyes.<br> To be concluded, online libraries have changed people’s life in many ways, but they also lead to some negative consequences. People should discern good from bad when using online libraries and use them reasonably and flexibly. Only in this way can online libraries better serve people and not the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>第三套：</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay on the use of Powerpoint in class. You can start your essay with the sentence “The use of Powerpoint in class is becoming increasingly popular.” You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The use of Powerpoint in class</strong></p>
<p> Popwerpoint, also known as PPT in short, is becoming an important teaching tool in class nowadays. With the combination of text, pictures, music and even movies, PPT provides students with vivid and interesting learning experience as well as a large amount of knowledge related. It helps teachers enrich their teaching methods better teaching effects and raise teaching efficiency.</p>
<p> But it goes without saying that there are still some drawbacks when using PPT in class. Firstly, some teachers tend to use PPT so excessively that they often read the text on PPT word by word without necessary explanation and interaction. This kind of action no doubt reduces teachers teaching pressure, but it is detrimental to students’ learning experience and learning effect. Secondly, some PPTs are made not so well, which will definitely impact teaching effect.</p>
<p> All in all,teachers should fully prepare lessons before class and carefully design their PPTs to improve their teaching effect and guarantee student’s learning result. </p>

<p><strong>翻译（3套）</strong></p>
<p><strong>第一套:</strong></p>
<p>​    你如果到北京旅游，必须做两件事，一件是登长城，另一件是吃北京烤鸭。闻名遐迩的北京烤鸭曾仅限于宫廷，而现在北京数百家餐厅均有供应。</p>
<p>   北京烤鸭源于600年前的明代，来自全国各地的厨师被挑选出来到京城为皇帝做饭，人们认为在皇宫做饭是一种莫大的荣誉，只有厨艺出众者才能获得这份工作。事实上，正是这些宫廷厨师使北京烤鸭的烹饪艺术日臻完善。</p>
<p>   If you travel to Beijing, you must put two things on your to-do list: one is to climb the Great Wall, and the other is to have a taste of Peking duck. The well-known Peking duck was once exclusive to the imperial court, but now there are hundreds of restaurants in Beijing to choose from.</p>
<p>  Peking duck originated in the Ming Dynasty 600 years ago. Cooks from all over the country were selected to cook for the emperor in the capital. Being a chef in the palace was considered a great honor, and only those who were excellent at cooking could get the job. In fact, it is the court chefs who have perfected the cooking skills of Peking Duck.</p>
<p><strong>第二套:</strong></p>
<p>​    茶拥有5000年的历史。传说，神农氏( Shen Nong)喝开水时，几片野树叶子落进壶里，开水顿时散发出宜人的香味。他喝了几口，觉得很提神。茶就这样发现了。</p>
<p>​    自此，茶在中国开始流行。茶园遍布全国，茶商变得富有。昂贵、雅致的茶具成了地位的象征。</p>
<p>​    今天，茶不仅是一种健康的饮品，而且是中国文化的一个组成部分。越来越多的国际游客一边品茶，一边了解中国文化。</p>
<p>  Tea has a history of 5000 years. Legend has it that when Shen Nong was drinking boiling water, several leaves of wild trees fell into the pot, and the boiling water immediately gave off a pleasant fragrance. He took a few sips and felt refreshed. So tea was discovered.</p>
<p>  Since then, tea has become popular in China. Tea plantations spread all over the country and tea merchants became rich. Expensive and elegant tea sets became a symbol of status.</p>
<p>  Today, tea is not only a healthy drink, but also an integral part of Chinese culture. More and more international tourists learn about Chinese culture while tasting tea.</p>
<p><strong>第三套:</strong></p>
<p>​    茅台（Moutai）是中国最有名的白酒，在新中国成立前夕，被选为国宴用酒。</p>
<p>​    据说赤水沿岸的村民四千年前就开始酿造茅台。在西汉时期，那里的人们生产出了高质量的茅台，并把它贡给皇帝。自唐朝开始，这种地方酒通过海上丝绸之路运往海外。</p>
<p>​    茅台味道柔和，有一种特殊的风味；适量饮用有助于缓解疲劳，有镇静作用，因而广受国内外消费者的喜爱。</p>
<p>  Moutai is the most famous wine in China. On the eve of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, it was selected as the wine for national banquets.</p>
<p>  It is said that villagers along the coast of Chishui began brewing Moutai 4 000 years ago. During the West Han Dynasty, people there produced high-quality Moutai and paid homage to the emperor. Since the Tang Dynasty, this local wine has been shipped overseas via the Maritime Silk Road.</p>
<p>  Moutai features mild flavor and unique fragrance. Moderate consumption helps to relieve fatigue and has a calming effect, so it is deeply loved by domestic and foreign consumers.</p>
