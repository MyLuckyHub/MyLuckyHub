<p><strong><em>🔸写作（3套）</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>第一套</strong></p>
<p>Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay on the saying “Wealth of the mind is the only true wealth.”  You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words.</p>
<p>There is a widespread saying that wealth of the mind is the only true wealth.</p>
<p>Simple as the saying is, it informs us that spiritual richness should be attached great importance to.</p>
<p>With the development of economy, people in increasing numbers become better off. However, money doesn’t necessarily ensure happiness or well-being. Therefore, in order to gain wealth of the mind, we should lay great emphasis on meaningful things. For instance, lifelong learning, by occupying people’s time so constructively, make people contented, with no time for boredom.  Little by little, enriching oneself has become the source of happiness and contentment and that’s when one gains true wealth of the mind.</p>
<p>Therefore, by some means or other we must come to know how to enrich our mind. It is necessary for us students to adopt a healthy and meaningful life style by improving ourselves constantly. Only in this way can we obtain true wealth in life.</p>
<p><strong>第二套</strong></p>
<p>Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay on the saying “What is worth doing is worth doing well.”  You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words.</p>
<p><strong>What Is Worth Doing Is Worth Doing Well</strong></p>
<p>The saying “What is worth doing is worth doing well” tells us that if you decide to do something, then you have to to it well and to the best of your ability, which means paying attention to every little detail of the thing that you are doing to make sure it is done properly.</p>
<p>Some people are against the idea, saying that when it comes to implementing an idea, things that are worth doing are worth doing poorly, because many things don’t get done at all for the reason that the concern for perfection trumps the practice of “just do it”. As for me, there are many reasons for doing things well. Firstly, taking the time to learn how to do things well, even though it may be slower at first, will allow you to be more proficient in the future. Secondly, doing things well is an attitude which is important for your life development. Right attitude matters most, but not the result.</p>
<p>So, if you think something is worth doing, just try to do it well. You’ll finally get a sense of accomplishment for a job well done, and make further improvement.</p>
<p><strong>第三套</strong></p>
<p>Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay on the saying “Beauty of the soul is the essential beauty.” You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words.</p>
<p><strong>Beauty of the soul is the essential beauty</strong></p>
<p>There is a famous saying that beauty of the soul is the essential beauty. It tells us that man’s spiritual beauty is much more important than his outer beauty.</p>
<p>Spiritual beauty is something to which a person needs to pay attention, because, as he gets on with his life, all deeds and actions are drawn from that inner beauty. Spiritual beauty is the reflection of one’s cultivation, self-restraint and bearing. Appearance is just some external representation, such as people’s clothing, family background, education. Having a good degree, you may find a decent job, but without the fortitude, the good job will eventually leave you. Therefore, only the spiritual beauty is worth pursuing and cherishing.</p>
<p>All in all, everyone should have a pair of eyes to find beauty and love beauty. Beauty is not in your appearance, not in your identity, but in your soul.</p>

<p>Six Potential Brain Benefits of Bilingual Education</p>
<p><strong>HCJDM</strong> <strong>EBPGN</strong></p>
<p>\36. A study found that there are similar changes in brain structure between those who are bilingual from birth and those who start learning a second language later.</p>
<p>H But Gigi Luk at Harvard cites at least one brain-imagine study on adolescents that shows similar changes in brain structure structure when compared with those who are bilingual from birth,</p>
<p>Do these same advantages benefit a child who begins learning a second language in kindergarten in-stead of as a baby?</p>
<p>\37. Unlike traditional monolingual programs, bilingual classrooms aim at developing students’ ability to use two languages by middle school.</p>
<p>C Traditional programs for English-language learners,… Dual-language classrooms</p>
<p>\38. A study showed that dual-language students did significantly better than their peers in reading English texts.</p>
<p>J About 10 percent of students in the Port-land,</p>
<p>\39. About twenty years ago, bilingual practice was strongly discouraged, especially in California.</p>
<p>D The trend flies in the face of some of the culture wars of two decades ago,</p>
<p>\40. Ethnically and economically balanced bilingual classrooms are found to be helpful for kids to get used to social and cultural diversity.</p>
<p>M American public school classrooms as a whole are becoming more segregated by race and class Du-al-language programs can be an exception.</p>
<p>\41. Researchers now claim that earlier research on bilingual education was seriously flawed.</p>
<p>E Some of the insistence on English-first was founded on research produced decades ago,</p>
<p>\42. According to a researcher, dual-language experiences exert a lifelong influence on one’s brain.</p>
<p>B Again and again, researchers have found,” bilingualism is an experience that shapes our brain for life,”</p>
<p>\43. Advocates of bilingual education argued that it produces positive effects though they may be limited.</p>
<p>P A review of studies published last year found that cognitive advantages failed to appear in 83 per-cent of published studies,</p>
<p>\44. Bilingual speakers often do better than monolinguals in completing certain tasks because they can concentrate better on what they are doing.</p>
<p>G People who speak two languages often outperform monolinguals on general measures of executive function.</p>
<p>\45. When their native language is used, parents can become more involved in their children’s education.</p>

<p><strong><em>🔸翻译（共3套）</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>第一篇</strong></p>
<p>《西游记》( Journey to the West)也许是中国文学四大经典小说中最具影响力的一部，当然也是在国外最广为人知的一部小说。这部小说描绘了著名僧侣玄奘在三个随从的陪同下穿越中国西部地区前往印度取经( Buddhist scripture)的艰难历程。虽然故事的主题基于佛教，但这部小说采用了大量中国民间故事和神话的素材，创造了各种栩栩如生的人物和动物形象。其中最著名的是孙悟空，他与各种各样妖魔作斗争的故事几乎为每个中国孩子所熟知。</p>
<p>Journey to the West is perhaps the most influential of the four classic novels in Chinese literature, and of course it is also the most widely known novel in foreign countries. The novel describes that Xuanzang, a famous monk accompanied by three followers, travelled arduously through western China to India for the Buddhist scripture. Although the main story is based on Buddhism, the novel uses a large number of Chinese folk stories and myths of material, creating a variety of vivid  figures and animal images.
